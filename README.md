# 🌍 Atmospheric Layers Model (ISA Standard)

This MATLAB project calculates **atmospheric properties** (temperature, pressure, density, and speed of sound) for different altitude layers **up to 32 km**, based on the **International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)** model.  

## 📌 Features
✅ Computes **temperature**, **pressure**, **density**, and **speed of sound** at a given altitude  
✅ Supports **multiple atmospheric layers** with standard **ISA lapse rates**  
✅ **Plots** atmospheric properties vs. altitude  
✅ User-friendly input validation (**Max altitude: 32 km**)  

## 📖 Based on ISA Standard  
This model follows the **International Standard Atmosphere (ISA)**, which provides a reference for atmospheric properties at different altitudes. The standard lapse rates and isothermal layers are implemented as per ISA specifications.  

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Run the script in **MATLAB**  
2. Enter an altitude (meters) within the valid range (0 - 32,000 m)  
3. Get calculated atmospheric properties  
4. View plots for different parameters
